<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>NTUtils is a collection of utilities that may be useful to Win32 system administrators, in the spirit of pstools by <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">Systems Internals</a> (now <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default">part of TechNet</a>). Unlike pstools, the programs in NTUtils are open-source, and demonstrate some lesser known but relatively simple techniques. As the name implies, they do not support the Windows 9x line.</p>

<p>Furthermore, all NTUtils programs may be built using freely-available, open-source tools.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>NTUtils is hosted <a href="https://github.com/StephenClearyArchive/NTUtils">at GitHub</a>. You can download the most recent release from the <a href="https://github.com/StephenClearyArchive/NTUtils/releases">releases there</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Place the executables somewhere in your PATH. The only run-time dependencies are on OS DLLs (including msvcrt.dll).</p>

<h2>Uninstallation</h2>

<p>Delete the executables. All NTUtils programs have zero-footprint, meaning all temporary files, registry entries, and any other changes to the machine exist only while the NTUtils program is running.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>Each NTUtils program is designed with a Unix-like mentality: do one thing and do it well. Many of the programs share some common functionality, however.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>To the excellent minds at <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">Systems Internals</a>, for making such wonderful software freely available; to Gary Nebbett, for his research into the native NT API; and to all the developers from the Boost, Cygwin, Mingw, and win32api projects for their tireless sacrificial work - the NTUtils team acknowledges that if their programs see great things, it is because they have stood on the shoulders of great software.</p>
