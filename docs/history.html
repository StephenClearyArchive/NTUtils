<h2>Version 1.3.0 (released 2005-07-07)</h2>

<h3>Contents</h3>

<ul>
<li>ntpriority</li>
<li>ntsuspend</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>NOTE: The stdout/stderr/return code standards have changed with this release!</li>
<li>All programs when executing remotely will recognize existing network connections to <span class="code">IPC$</span> and preserve them instead of deleting them when complete.</li>
<li>Put in a small delay followed by a retry when <span class="code">DeleteFile</span> fails (this is due to timing issues with the OS closing the file handle); this should fix most of the warnings from this function that occasionally appear. Note that these warnings may still happen in some circumstances.</li>
<li>Added support for stable XML output.</li>
<li>Changed versioning scheme to include a &quot;release&quot; number as well as major and minor version numbers.</li>
<li>Refactored source tree.</li>
<li>Removed 255-character restrictions on process names when operating remotely.</li>
<li>Changed the list operation semantics: NTUTils programs will now always continue with the next target, instead of exiting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.2 (released 2005-06-27)</h2>

<h3>Contents</h3>

<ul>
<li>ntpriority</li>
<li>ntsuspend</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added <span class="code">ntpriority</span>.</li>
<li>Refactored some of the code to make it more reusable.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in makefile that would prevent it from making executables that did not already exist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.1 (released 2005-06-19)</h2>

<h3>Contents</h3>

<ul>
<li>ntsuspend</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Corrected bug in reading passwords from console input. Specifying <span class="code">-p</span> without an argument will now work correctly.</li>
<li>Put documentation in a CHM.</li>
<li>Corrected all security issues:
 <ul>
 <li>A more restrictive DACL was defined for the server-side named pipe, allowing anyone to connect but preventing anyone from taking ownership or changing the DACL.</li>
 <li>Changed the reading of the named pipe to be done before impersonation begins (i.e., using the creator/owner's security context).</li>
 <li>Ensured that enabling the debug privilege is done with the proper impersonated context instead of the process security context.</li>
 <li>Ensured that the impersonation level of the impersonation is at least at a level where impersonating is being done, instead of anonymous or identify impersonation level.</li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>
