<h2>Version 1.1 (released 2005-06-19)</h2>

<h3>Contents</h3>

<ul>
<li>ntsuspend</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Corrected bug in reading passwords from console input. Specifying <span class="code">-p</span> without an argument will now work correctly.</li>
<li>Put documentation in a CHM.</li>
<li>Corrected all security issues:
 <ul>
 <li>A more restrictive DACL was defined for the server-side named pipe, allowing anyone to connect but preventing anyone from taking ownership or changing the DACL.</li>
 <li>Changed the reading of the named pipe to be done before impersonation begins (i.e., using the creator/owner's security context).</li>
 <li>Ensured that enabling the debug privilege is done with the proper impersonated context instead of the process security context.</li>
 <li>Ensured that the impersonation level of the impersonation is at least at a level where impersonating is being done, instead of anonymous or identify impersonation level.</li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>
