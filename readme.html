<h1 align="center">NTUtils version 1.0</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>NTUtils is a collection of utilities that may be useful to Win32 system administrators, in the spirit of pstools by <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">Systems Internals</a>. Unlike pstools, the programs in NTUtils are open-source, and demonstrate some lesser known but relatively simple techniques. As the name implies, they do not support the Windows 9x line.</p>

<p>Furthermore, all NTUtils programs may be built using freely-available, open-source tools.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Place the executables somewhere in your PATH. The only run-time dependency is on OS DLLs and msvcrt.dll.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>Each NTUtils program is designed with a Unix-like mentality: do one thing and do it well. Many of the programs share some common functionality, however.</p>

<h2>Dedication</h2>

<p>NTUtils is dedicated to Sarah Billings, the best friend anyone could ever hope to have. Without her, none of this would have been possible.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>To the excellent minds at <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">Systems Internals</a>, for making such wonderful software freely available; to Gary Nebbett, for his research into the native NT API; and to all the developers from the Boost, Cygwin, Mingw, and win32api projects for their tireless sacrificial work - the NTUtils team acknowledges that if their programs see great things, it is because they have stood on the shoulders of great software.</p>
